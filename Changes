0.42     2018-05-01
        - Prevent double encoding of URL in oauth2_auth_request helper

        - Note that this requires a much more recent version of Mojolicious
          so the requirement has been bumped to v7.76

0.41     2018-04-16
        - Handle inconsistencies between various grant types and the return
          data from ->verify_token_and_scope sometimes returning a hash ref
          and sometimes returning a string - now they always return a hash
          ref in the case of a successful authentication (GH #20)

        - Note that this may be a BREAKING CHANGE if you are using password
          grant in your app

        - Requires v0.17 of Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer for these changes

0.40     2018-02-02
        - Add oauth2_auth_request helper to get at redirect URI that results
          from the authorization process

0.39     2018-09-01
        - Add failing test case for return values when refresh token is
          a JWT (GH #17, thanks to pierre-vigier)
        - Fix above issue by bumping requirement on N::O::AuthorizationServer
          to v0.16

0.38     2017-06-01
        - Fix combination of verify_client and jwt_secret causing tokens
          to be generated when verify_client return 0 for client_credentials
          grant

0.37     2017-05-12
        - Add support for jwt_claims callback in config
          (see jwt_claims_cb in Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer)

0.36     2017-05-03
        - Fix bug in test for version 0.34 due to requiring url_decode
          of access token in implicit grant flow

0.35     2017-03-06
        - Fix bug in test for previous version

0.34     2017-03-06
        - Fix implicit grant should return query params in a fragment

0.33     2017-03-03
        - Fix tests for recent version of Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer

0.32     2016-11-01
        - Remove args_as_hash, this is now the default

0.31     2016-10-01
        - Deprecate args_as_hash, will become the standard as from the next version

0.30     2016-09-16
        - Add "Client Credentials Grant" flow (response_type = "client_credentials"
          in call to access_token)
        - Improve test coverage for Implicit Grant
        - Fix setting of scopes for JWT in Implicit Grant revealed by improved test
          coverage

0.29     2016-08-31
        - Fix Implicit Grant needs to be able to support login_resource_owner and
          confirm_by_resource_owner callbacks

0.28     2016-08-31
        - Fix don't allow clients defined with a client_secret to use the Implicit
          Grant Flow (handled in Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer, but add tests here)

0.27     2016-08-31
        - Add "Implicit Grant" flow (response_type = "token" in call to authorize)

0.26     2016-05-12
        - Transfer repo from G3S to Humanstate

0.25     2016-04-17
        - Add "Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant"

0.24     2016-04-11
        - split out bulk of code into Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer
        - ditto for examples and bulk of the perldoc
        - plugin is fully backwards compatible, although you may want to
          move to using the args_as_hash option for cleaner callbacks
          see docs for Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer::AuthorizationCodeGrant

0.23     2015-10-21
        - move github repo to Humanstate org

0.22     2015-06-25
        - auth codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens returned can now be
          JWTs (implemented via Mojo::JWT). this allows validation without
          database lookup *should you want to do that*

        - this allows the "simple" usage of the plugin to be persistent and
          multi process compat by supplying a jwt_secret - although you lose
          the automatic token revoking capabilities of the module when doing
          this. see the examples, tests, and perldoc for more information

0.11     2015-03-19
        - update examples/oauth2_client.pl to work with latest version of
          Mojolicious::Plugin::OAuth2. point to examples/ in the perldoc
        - tweaks to perldoc to highlight that this is an implementation of
          the "Authorization Code Grant" flow

0.10     2015-03-17
        - change token_type to be Bearer rather than bearer as this maps better
          for use in the Authorization header

0.09     2015-03-16
        - fix refresh_token check to prevent it being used as an access token.
          this adds an extra argument ($is_refresh_token) to the method that
          is called to _verify_access_token

0.08     2015-02-12
        - stipulate CryptX in the Makefile.PL rather than Crypt::PRNG, as the
          latter doesn't have a VERSION number so causes dependency check to
          fail (thanks to reneeb for the report/fix)
        - some tweaks in examples

0.07     2015-02-11
        - call verify_client before redirecting to login / confirm scopes
          as there's no point logging a user in, etc, if the client is bad
        - make _verify_access_token return a list as _verify_auth_code so
          we can report the failure reason in a meaningful way.
        - Add example schema and code for using the module with a relational
          database
        - harden token generation function using Crypt::PRNG random_string

0.06     2015-02-10
        - test and documentation for flash + redirect in a full fat app

0.05     2015-02-07
        - use warnings and fix any raised by tests

0.04     2015-02-06
        - refatoring and consistency tweaks

0.03     2015-02-06
        - fix regexp in tests to be looser

0.02     2015-02-06
        - POD tweaks
        - set minimum perl version (5.10.1)

0.01     2015-02-06
        - First release inspired by frustration, confusion, and hate when trying
          to implement OAuth2 resource/auth server using existing CPAN modules
